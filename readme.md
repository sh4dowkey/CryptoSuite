## ‚ú® Why CryptoSuite?

CryptoSuite is intended as a small, well-documented collection of cryptographic utilities for learning, experimentation, and lightweight tooling. The project aims to provide readable implementations, clear examples, and a friendly API so you (or contributors) can extend it with real cryptographic primitives and integrations.

## üöß Current Status

* **Repository status:** Work in Progress
* ‚úÖ **Implemented:** Base64 encoding & decoding utilities (stable)
* ‚õî **Planned / TODO:** AES, hashing, HMAC, steganography, GUI/web UI, CLI polish

> See **Roadmap** below for details.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

**Available now**

* `base64.encode()` ‚Äî encode text/bytes to Base64
* `base64.decode()` ‚Äî decode Base64 back to text/bytes

**Planned features**

* AES (CBC / GCM) symmetric encryption utilities
* SHA-family hashing helpers and HMAC wrappers
* Steganography helpers for images (PNG/JPEG) and audio
* Small GUI (Dark theme) and a simple web UI for quick demos
* CLI tool with subcommands and flags
* Tests, CI, documentation site

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sh4dowkey/CryptoSuite.git
cd CryptoSuite

# (Optional) create venv and activate
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
# source .venv/bin/activate

# Install (if dependencies added later)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*No external packages are required for the Base64 utilities included today ‚Äî but keep `requirements.txt` for future additions.*

---

## üß© Usage Examples

### Import & use in Python

```python
from cryptosuite import base64

text = "Hello, CryptoSuite!"
encoded = base64.encode(text)
print(encoded)
# -> SGVsbG8sIENyeXB0b1N1aXRlIQ==

decoded = base64.decode(encoded)
print(decoded)
# -> Hello, CryptoSuite!
```

### CLI (future)

Planned CLI usage will be similar to:

```bash
# encode
cryptosuite base64 encode "some text"

# decode
cryptosuite base64 decode SGVsbG8=
```

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

**v0.1** (current)

* Base64 encode/decode
* README, basic examples

**v0.2**

* Add AES (CBC/GCM) with proper IV handling
* Add unit tests & CI pipeline

**v0.3**

* Hashing / HMAC helpers
* CLI with subcommands

**v1.0**

* GUI / Web interface (dark theme by default)
* Steganography utilities
* Release & documentation site
